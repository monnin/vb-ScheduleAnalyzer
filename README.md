ScheduleAnalyzer

This program examines an Excel spreadsheet that contains a number of classes, and evaluates them for various problems (e.g. two
classes that are scheduled for the same room or for the same instructor at the exact same time).   If a seperate tab contains expected
student schedules, it will verify that the students can take all of the courses (aka not two courses at the same time).
